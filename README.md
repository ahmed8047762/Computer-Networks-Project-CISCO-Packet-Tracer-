# Computer Networks Project
This project involves the implementation of various networking protocols using the CISCO Packet Tracer application. The following protocols have been implemented:

* EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
* RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
* OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
* NAT (Network Address Translation)
## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have the CISCO Packet Tracer application installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of the application from the https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer.

Once you have the application installed, you can open the provided project files to explore the implementation of the various networking protocols.

## EIGRP
EIGRP is a Cisco proprietary routing protocol that is used for routing within an autonomous system. It uses a hybrid distance vector and link-state algorithm and supports multiple network layer protocols.

In this project, we have implemented EIGRP on a network of three routers, with each router connected to multiple LANs. The EIGRP configuration and routing table for each router can be found in the relevant project files.

## RIP
RIP is a distance-vector routing protocol that is used for routing within a small network. It uses a simple routing algorithm that calculates the shortest path to a destination network based on the number of hops.

In this project, we have implemented RIP on a network of three routers, with each router connected to multiple LANs. The RIP configuration and routing table for each router can be found in the relevant project files.

## OSPF
OSPF is a link-state routing protocol that is used for routing within a large network. It uses a complex routing algorithm that calculates the shortest path to a destination network based on the cost of the path.

In this project, we have implemented OSPF on a network of three routers, with each router connected to multiple LANs. The OSPF configuration and routing table for each router can be found in the relevant project files.

## NAT
NAT is a networking technology that allows devices on a private network to communicate with devices on a public network, such as the Internet. It involves the translation of private IP addresses to public IP addresses and vice versa.

In this project, we have implemented NAT on a network of three routers, with one router acting as a NAT device. The NAT configuration and mapping table for the NAT router can be found in the relevant project files.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of various networking protocols using the CISCO Packet Tracer application. It provides a good understanding of the working of these protocols and how they can be configured in a network.
